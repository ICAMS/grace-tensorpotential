# GRACE - GRaph Atomic Cluster Expansion

Project GRACEmaker is a heavily modified and in large parts rewritten version of the PACEmaker software geared towards support for multi-component materials and graph architectures.

Please see https://github.com/AntBoc/pace-tutorial-2024 for installation instructions and examples. 

More complete documentation will be available soon.
